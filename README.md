## AbyssOrangeMix2

‚Äï‚ÄïCreating the next generation of illustration with ‚ÄúAbyss‚Äù!

<img src="https://github.com/WarriorMama777/imgup/blob/main/img/AbyssOrangeMix2/HeroImage_AbyssOrangeMix2_Designed_01_comp001.webp?raw=true"  width="" height="" alt=‚ÄùHeroImage_AbyssOrangeMix2_Designed_01_comp001‚Äù>

‚ñºAbout

AbyssOrangeMix2 is an AI model capable of generating high-quality, highly realistic illustrations. 
It can generate elaborate and detailed illustrations that cannot be drawn by hand. It can also be used for a variety of purposes, making it extremely useful for design and artwork.
Furthermore, it provides an unparalleled new means of expression. 
It can generate illustrations in a variety of genres to meet a wide range of needs. I encourage you to use "Abyss" to make your designs and artwork richer and of higher quality.

‚ñºDescription for engineers/enthusiasts

The merged model was formulated using an extension such as sdweb-merge-block-weighted-gui, which merges models at separate rates for each of the 25 U-Net blocks (input, intermediate, and output).
The validation of many Anons has shown that such a recipe can generate a painting style that is anatomically realistic enough to feel the finger skeleton, but still maintains an anime-style face.

The changes from AbyssOrangeMix are as follows.

1. the model used for U-Net Blocks Weight Merge was changed from Instagram+F222 to BasilMix. (https://huggingface.co/nuigurumi)

This is an excellent merge model that can generate decent human bodies while maintaining the facial layers of the Instagram model. Thanks!!!
This has improved the dullness of the color and given a more Japanese skin tone (or more precisely, the moisturized white skin that the Japanese would ideally like).
Also, the unnatural bokeh that sometimes occurred in the previous version may have been eliminated (needs to be verified). 

2.Added IN deep layers (IN06-11) to the layer merging from the realistic model (BasilMix).

It is said that the IN deep layer (IN06-11) is the layer that determines composition, etc., but perhaps light, reflections, skin texture, etc., may also be involved.
It is like "Global Illumination," "Normal Map," and "Ambient Occlusion" in 3DCG.

<img src="https://github.com/WarriorMama777/imgup/blob/main/img/AbyssOrangeMix2/AbyssOrangeMix2_comparison_comp001.webp?raw=true"  width="" height="" alt=‚ÄùAbyssOrangeMix2_comparison_comp001‚Äù>

‚ÄªThis does not fundamentally improve the fingers, and I recommend using bad_prompt, etc. (Embedding) in combination.  
About 30-50% chance of generating correct fingers(?). Abyss is deep.

‚ñºSample Gallery

The prompts for generating these images were all generated using ChatGPT. I simply asked "Pirates sailing the oceans" to tell me what the prompts were.  
However, to make sure the AI understood the specifications, I used the template for AI questions (Question template for AI prompt generation(v1.2) ).   
Please review the following.

```jsx
https://seesaawiki.jp/nai_ch/d/AI%a4%f2%b3%e8%cd%d1%a4%b7%a4%bf%a5%d7%a5%ed%a5%f3%a5%d7%a5%c8%c0%b8%c0%ae
```

The images thus generated, strangely enough, look like MidJourney or Nijijourney illustrations. Perhaps they are passing user prompts through GPT or something else before passing them on to the image AIü§î

## EerieOrangeMixüçä

EerieOrangeMix is the generic name for a U-Net Blocks Weight Merge Models based on Elysium(Anime V2).  
Since there are infinite possibilities for U-Net Blocks Weight Merging, I plan to treat all Elysium-based models as a lineage of this model.

‚ÄªThis does not fundamentally improve the fingers, and I recommend using bad_prompt, etc. (Embedding) in combination.

### EerieOrangeMix

‚ñº?  

This merge model is simply a U-Net Blocks Weight Merge of ElysiumAnime V2 with the AbyssOrangeMix method.

The AnythingModel is good at cute girls anyway, and no matter how hard I try, it doesn't seem to be good at women in their late 20s and beyond. Therefore, I created a U-Net Blocks Weight Merge model based on my personal favorite ElysiumAnime V2 model. ElyOrangeMix was originally my favorite, so this is an enhanced version of that.

‚ñºHow to use

- ~~Prompts can be long or short~~  
As simple as possible is good. Do not add excessive detail prompts. Start with just this.
(worst quality, low quality:1.4)
- Sampler: ‚ÄúDPM++ SDE Karras‚Äù is good
- Steps: forTest: 20ÔΩû24 ,illustration: 24ÔΩû50
- Clipskip: 1
- USE ‚Äúupscale latent space‚Äù
- Denoise strength: 0.45 (0.4~0.5)
If you use 0.7ÔΩû, the picture will change too much.

‚ñºPrompts

üñåWhen generating cute girls, try this negative prompt first. It avoids low quality, prevents blurring, avoids dull colors, and dictates Anime-like cute face modeling.

### AbyssOrangeMix_base
