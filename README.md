# Model Detail & Merge Recipes




## AbyssOrangeMix

‚Äï‚ÄïHow can you guys take on such a deep swamp and get results?  
Is it something like "Made in Abyss"?

‚ñº?

The merged model was formulated using an extension such as sdweb-merge-block-weighted-gui, which merges models at separate rates for each of the 25 U-Net blocks (input, intermediate, and output).
The validation of many Anons has shown that such a recipe can generate a painting style that is anatomically realistic enough to feel the finger skeleton, but still maintains an anime-style face.

‚ÄªThis model is the result of a great deal of testing and experimentation by many Anonsü§ó
‚ÄªThis model can be very difficult to handle. I am not 100% confident in my ability to use this model. It is peaky and for experts.

### AbyssOrangeMix_base

‚ñº?

The basic trick for this merged model is to incorporate a model that has learned more than 1m Instagram photos (mostly Japanese) or a photorealistic model like f222. The choice of base model here depends on the person. I chose AnythingV3 for versatility.

This is a merge model that improves on the Elysium_Anime_V2, where NSFW representation is not good.
